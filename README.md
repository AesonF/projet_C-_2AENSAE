# PDE solver for Black-Scholes

## Team
Yacine Falaki, Aeson Feehan

## Description
This a programming project for the dedicated course taught by Jean-Baptiste Yun√®s at ENSAE Paris in the second year of the school's master's program. It is entirely written in C++ and consists in the implementation and application of the Black-Scholes model for pricing financial derivatives.

For visualising results, use the files in the _graphs_ folder and install __Qt__. Qt provides all of the code regarding visualisation and display. If you are only interested in numerical outputs or the matrix class we created, just run files
- ``main.cpp``
- ``matrix.cpp`` and ``matrix.h``
- ``eqres.cpp`` and ``eqres.h``

## Languages
The code is largely commented in French and the report (attached pdf file) is written in French.
